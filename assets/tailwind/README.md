## Tailwind CSS Custom Templates

This directory contains assets and scripts for *front-end development* of the Tailwind CSS templates,
slightly adapted from the v2.x frontend branch.

The composer-scripts.json file contains some examples of development workflow scripts you could adapt
for your own composer.json file.

The package.json and *.config.js files should be copied to the project directory before you run
```
yarn install
```
or run any of the custom composer scripts there...
